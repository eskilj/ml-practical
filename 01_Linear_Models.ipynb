    "To activate virtual environment:\n",
    "   * If you were on Tuesday/Wednesday group type `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate`\n",

    "      + and if you have chosen **comfy** way type: workon mlpractival\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen **generic** way, `source` your virutal environment using `source` and specyfing the path to the activate script (you need to localise it yourself, there were not any general recommendations w.r.t dir structure and people have installed it in different places, usually somewhere in the home directories. If you cannot easily find it by yourself, use something like: `find . -iname activate` ):\n",

    "I started writing this, but do not think giving students a choice is a good way to progess, the most painless way to follow would be to ask them to stash their changes (with some meaningful message) and work on the clean updated repository. This way one can always (temporarily) recover the work once needed but everyone starts smoothly the next lab. We do not want to help anyone how to resolve the conflicts...\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your git mlp repository you set up last week (i.e. ~/mlpractical/repo-mlp) and depending on how you want to proceed you either can:\n",
    "  1. Overridde some changes you have made (both in the notebooks and/or in the code if you happen to modify parts that were updated by us) with the code we have provided for this lab\n",
    "  2. Try to merge your code with ours (for example, if you want to use `MetOfficeDataProvider` you have written)\n",
