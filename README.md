# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the 
  course that students will implement and extend during the course labs and assignments.
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing coding exercises and experimental results.

## Getting set up

Detailed instructions for setting up a development environment for the course are given in [this file](environment-set-up.md).
